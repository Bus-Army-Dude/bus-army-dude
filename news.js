        title: "The market's gonna boom,' says Trump as Wall Street tumbles over tariffs",
        shortDescription: "A day after President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs sent global markets tumbling - and his administration urged the American public to be patient - the president struck an optimistic note.",
        content: "WASHINGTON − A day after President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs sent global markets tumbling - and his administration urged the American public to be patient - the president struck an optimistic note. Wall Street and global stock exchanges took a sharp nosedive Thursday as investors braced for the possibility of a recession, after Trump imposed higher tariffs on dozens of countries − including some of America’s biggest trading partners. The S&P 500 was down 3.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 1,100 points or 2.6% at 12:40 p.m.On Thursday, Trump, who has declined to rule out the possibility of a recession, compared his “Liberation Day” tariffs to surgery as he delivered a positive prognosis on the White House South Lawn. I think it's going very well. It was an operation like when a patient gets operated, he said, adding that the move was already bringing in close to $7 trillion in investment. The markets are gonna boom. The stock is gonna boom the country's gonna boom, and the rest of the world wants to see is there any way they can make a deal he said. They've taken advantage of us for many, many years. On Wednesday as he unveiled his reciprocal tariffs plan in the Rose Garden, Trump said he was charging the countries a discounted reciprocal rate “because we are being very kind as he announced tariffs ranging from 10% to 49%. In a Thursday morning post on TruthSocial, Trump said the country would emerge stronger after the operation. THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING, he wrote. THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! Vice President JD Vance on Thursday defended the president's tariff move and said it would take time to see the benefits of the tariff and deregulation policy. What I’d ask folks to appreciate here is that we are not going to fix things overnight, Vance said Thursday during a FOX & Friends interview. We’ve seen closing factories, we’ve seen rising inflation. President Trump is taking this economy in a different direction. For instance, China, which was previously hit with a 20% tariff to address its role in the production of synthetic opioids, received an additional 34%, bringing the total to 54%. Cambodia was hit with a 49% tariff while Thailand came in at 36%. The reciprocal tariffs will go into effect on April 9. Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them, Trump said from the Rose Garden. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Trump’s 20% tariffs on the bloc of 27 countries is a major blow to the whole economy. The global economy will massively suffer, she said. Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The EU chief said she was prepared to implement countermeasures. A top House Democrat vowed to try forcing a vote to block the tariffs. I'll soon introduce a privileged resolution to force a vote on ending the made up national emergency Trump is using to justify these taxes, Rep. Greg Meeks, D-N.Y., the Foreign Affairs Committee's ranking member, wrote in a post on X. Trump just hit Americans with the largest regressive tax hike in modern history − massive tariffs on all imports, he said. While Democrats panned Trump’s tariff plans, Republicans were quick to defend the president. Rep. Rick Allen, R-Ga., said the president was undoing decades of unfair trade practices and putting American workers, businesses, and manufacturers FIRST. These reciprocal tariffs are simply leveling the playing field and will help ensure the U.S. is no longer on the losing end of global trade, he tweeted on X.",

        title: "South Koreans are celebrating Yoon’s impeachment, but the saga is far from over Raphael Rashid in Seoul and Justin McCurry",
        shortDescription: "Whoever becomes president later this year has unenviable task of healing divisions and rebuilding trust in democratic institutions",
        content: "It had been a long and at times intolerable wait. But the South Korean constitutional court’s decision on Friday to oust Yoon Suk Yeol from office may have restored the public’s faith in their democracy. For 22 minutes, millions of South Koreans held their breath as the chief justice of the constitutional court, Moon Hyung-bae, began delivering the court’s verdict on Yoon’s impeachment over his chaotic declaration of martial law in December. With each damning statement, Moon raised the hopes of the crowds outside who had been demanding the suspended president’s permanent removal from office. Yoon’s actions, he said, had constituted a serious challenge to democracy, adding that the 64-year-old conservative populist had committed a grave betrayal of the people’s trust in bringing about South Korea’s worst political crisis since it became a democracy in the late 1980s. When Moon finally uttered the words: The defendant president Yoon Suk Yeol is hereby removed from office, the crowd erupted with cheers. The ruling sets in motion a 60-day countdown to elect a new leader, the date to be confirmed within 10 days by the acting president, Han Duck-soo. Political parties are already scrambling to select candidates, with the Democratic party’s Lee Jae-myung – a longtime Yoon nemesis – currently leading the polls. Yoon’s conservative People Power party, meanwhile, has the unenviable task of selecting a candidate who is untainted by association with Yoon’s failed administration. The national assembly’s first impeachment vote in December was an opportunity for the party to distance itself from Yoon. Instead, People Power MPs doubled down, boycotting the vote and continuing to back their embattled leader. They then amplified what many believe to be Yoon’s groundless claims that previous elections, including a national assembly vote earlier in the year, had been mired in voting fraud. The conspiracy theories found fertile ground among Yoon’s supporters, who adopted Trump-style slogans such as stop the stealing as they took to the streets. By invoking cold war language about pro-North Korean, anti-state forces to describe his political opponents, analysts said Yoon deepened the political divide in an already polarised country. Whoever becomes president later this year faces the unenviable task of healing those divisions and rebuilding trust in the democratic institutions that Yoon so casually undermined. The ruling marked the end of a tumultuous three years for the conservative populist. The former senior prosecutor who had led the case for impeachment against the then president, Park Geun-hye in 2017, now has the same ignominious postscript to his presidency. Having won the 2022 election – beating the liberal Lee by the slimmest of margins – Yoon was initially admired as an assertive and strong-willed leader, until those qualities were exposed as an unwillingness to compromise or accept criticism. As he struggled to implement budgets and key policies in the opposition-controlled national assembly, Yoon grew increasingly irritable, targeting critical journalists, confronting striking doctors, blocking attempts to investigate corruption allegations involving the first lady, Kim Keon Hee, and labelling opposition MPs as a den of criminals working in cahoots with communist North Korea. Human rights activists welcomed Friday’s verdict. In a statement, Human Rights Watch said Yoon’s attempt to impose martial law had posed a grave threat to human rights and the rule of law. It added: If martial law had been maintained, South Koreans would have faced the risk of arrest and detention without trial as well as severe restrictions on their freedom of expression and assembly, among other human rights violations. The constitutional court’s ruling was a decisive step to uphold human rights protections and democratic values. Some characterise Yoon’s removal as the start of a process to restore public faith in South Korea as a liberal democracy with a successful economy and a culture admired around the world. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the court’s verdict had removed a major source of uncertainty. And not a moment too soon, given how the next administration in Seoul must navigate North Korea’s military threats, China’s diplomatic pressure, and Trump’s trade tariffs. It is a sentiment shared by anti-Yoon protesters who had gathered outdoors to watch a live broadcast of the verdict. When his removal was announced, they cheered, danced and cried. When the dismissal was finally declared, the cheers were so loud it felt like the rally was being swept away, said Kim Min-ji, a 25-year-old protester. We cried tears and shouted that we, the citizens, had won! But the saga is far from over. Few believe that candidates and voters in the forthcoming presidential election will be able to put the acrimony of the past four months behind them, while Yoon faces a separate criminal trial on charges of insurrection – a crime that carries a maximum term of life imprisonment or the death penalty. If people start refusing to accept any election outcome that is unfavourable to them, the other side will start doing the same, said Kim Tae-hyung, a professor at Soongsil University in Seoul. If that cycle continues, trust in democracy will completely collapse.",

        title: "Donald Trump floats China tariff relief in exchange for TikTok sale approval",
        shortDescription: "US president suggests he is open to horse-trading a day after imposing severe import levies on Chinese goods",
        content: "President Donald Trump has suggested he could cut tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing allows ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, to divest the hugely popular video sharing app to avoid a ban in the US. We have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say we’ll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariffs, Trump said aboard Air Force One. The tariffs give us great power to negotiate. The comments came one day after Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs on dozens of nations, including a 34%  levy on imports from China that followed the 20% tariff he imposed earlier this year. Trump also said his administration was very close to reaching a deal with multiple investors that would allow TikTok to continue to operate in the US. Congress last year passed legislation requiring ByteDance to divest the app or face a nationwide ban. Trump extended the deadline for divestment until Saturday. Lawmakers passed the legislation to address security concerns about possible Chinese government influence over TikTok’s algorithm. Security officials are also concerned that ByteDance’s ownership of TikTok would enable Beijing to obtain the personal data of millions of Americans. We’re very close to a deal with a very good group of people, Trump said. Earlier on Thursday, vice-president JD Vance told Fox News the deal would come out before the deadline. The White House this week held talks to thrash out the contours of a deal that would be palatable to Republicans, as well as ByteDance and the Chinese government, which would need to give its blessing. The administration has been weighing a proposal to spin off TikTok from its Chinese parent. It would create a new US entity and include fresh American investment to dilute the ownership stakes of Chinese investors, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. Under the proposal, new outside investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Blackstone, Silver Lake and other big private capital firms, would own about half of TikTok’s US business, the people said.  Large existing investors in TikTok, including General Atlantic, Susquehanna, KKR and Coatue, would hold 30% of the US entity, while ByteDance would keep a stake at just below 20%. This would adhere to requirements in the US law that no more than a fifth of the company be controlled by a foreign adversary. Oracle, meanwhile, would provide data security to the company.  But one big flashpoint is who would control TikTok’s highly sought-after algorithm. One option under discussion was that ByteDance would continue to develop and operate the algorithm — which has been a central demand of the Chinese government — while the new US group could access it through a licensing agreement, the people said.  However, China hawks and legal academics have argued that the algorithm needs to be fully operated by the US entity to meet the requirements of the legislation. Several members of the Trump administration, including secretary of state Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz, were vocal opponents of allowing China to retain control of the app when they served in Congress. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. A ByteDance representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        title: "Perrysburg teacher accused of following student home has other incidents in personnel file",
        shortDescription: "William Hilt's more than 200-page personnel file includes several incidents of alleged educator misconduct.",
        content: `TOLEDO, Ohio — A Perrysburg Schools teacher who was criminally charged after allegedly following a student home to see if they had completed their homework has additional recorded incidents in his personnel file, including having students give him back rubs in exchange for candy and perpetuating a racial stereotype.
    WTOL 11 obtained the personnel file for William "Bill" Hilt, who is employed as a teacher at Hull Prairie Intermediate School.
    The personnel file dates back to 1993 and includes letters of recommendation from Bluffton College, which he attended. Hilt applied for a sixth grade teaching position in May 1993; an attached criminal history check in August of the same year describes his record check as "acceptable."
    In July 1994, Hilt received a letter from Perrysburg's then-superintendent congratulating him on his hiring. He worked at Perrysburg Junior High School before being transferred to Hull Prairie in 2017, which is when the latter school opened.
    Throughout his time at Perrysburg Schools, Hilt has been the subject of several incidents that are detailed in his file. WTOL 11 is continuing to review Hilt's full personnel file, and will update this story with additional information as it becomes available.
    June 2014: A parent claimed Hilt violated a student's 504 plan (a formal document that provides classroom accommodations for students with disabilities) and claimed that Hilt engaged in "repeated intimidation." The investigation found that, at times, Hilt would be inappropriate in his actions when addressing students in his classroom. There were corrective actions, according to the file.
    September 2014: Hilt was reported for allegedly using a racial stereotype in a lesson. The document claims he made disparaging comments about Black people owning dogs.
    October 2014: Students made complaints about Hilt bullying and harassing them. A "pre-disciplinary hearing" for this incident was scheduled, according to the file.
    November 2014: A letter from Perrysburg Superintendent Tom Hosler states Hilt was recently suspended for disciplinary reasons.
    April 2023: An email states there were claims Hilt was yelling in class. There were also claims of him receiving neck and shoulder massages from male students. In the email, Hilt claims it was a lapse of judgement and he was going through personal difficulties. The email also says students claimed the massages happened on more than one day.
    December 2024: An heavily-redacted document appears to show that a meeting regarding a student became confrontational. In an email, the principal outlines a meeting about this incident with Hilt, saying Hilt assured him he will maintain a professional and supportive learning environment.
    January 2025: A public records request claims there was an incident on Dec. 19, 2024, involving Hilt. The request says other parents have complained about his behavior this year and prior years.
    February 2025 : An email from parent claims Hilt was having students give him back rubs in exchange for candy. The principal states he did not find evidence to substantiate the claim, however students he spoke with expressed anxiety about attending Hilt's classes. The principal also received a separate email claiming Hilt's interactions with a student were inappropriate and bullying. Students were removed from his 'team.'
    Hilt was put on paid leave on March 19 after reportedly following a student's bus home, and was criminally charged with trespassing on April 1.
    He is scheduled to have a general investigatory conference on Friday to discuss the claim he followed a student home.
    A police report says the parent told the principal they were unaware the teacher was planning on coming to their residence and "found it to be really weird and concerning."
    According to the police report, the teacher stated he sometimes does this for students and asked the student if he could follow their bus home.`,

    title: "Trump eyeing plan to avoid TikTok ban as deadline looms: Source",
    shortDescription: "The deadline for the app to be sold is April 5.",
    content: `The algorithm is the secret sauce that makes TikTok so addictive and popular, and it's the source of national security concerns over Chinese ownership of the app.

Because of that, the source said buyers are demanding liability protection. They are only willing to spend billions on TikTok if there are guarantees that they won't be sued by the next administration, according to the source.

In flux right now is how they will be given that guarantee. Potential buyers are looking for an indemnification or an adjustment to the law, which would need congressional action.

Among those potential buyers: Amazon. The company sent a letter to the Trump administration to join the bidding war for TikTok, sources told ABC News.

The mobile tech company AppLovin and a group including tech giant Oracle have also made bids to buy the app.

President Donald Trump while speaking aboard Air Force One on Thursday hinted that his recently announced tariffs on China could be a negotiating tactic to achieve a deal on a TikTok sale, noting, "If somebody said that we're going to give you something that's so phenomenal, as long as they're giving us something, that's good."

"We have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say, we'll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariff?" he said. "The tariffs give us great power to negotiate."

Even if Trump approves a deal, China will still need to sign off on it, and Beijing isn't too happy right now with the country about to be hit with a whopping 54% tariff.

On Wednesday, Trump and senior administration officials considered multiple proposals. It's unclear if a decision has been made on how to move forward.

Trump has said publicly that if an agreement isn't reached by the deadline, he will just extend it.

The White House has not immediately responded to requests for comment.`,

    content: `Zendaya has confirmed that Season 3 of HBO’s *Euphoria* will begin production in late 2025, after months of speculation and delays caused by the writers' and actors' strikes in 2023. 

In an exclusive interview with Variety, the Emmy-winning actress shared, “The story will pick up a few years later, and we’re diving into how these characters evolve into adulthood.”

Fans have been anxiously waiting for updates, especially following the tragic passing of co-star Angus Cloud in 2023. Series creator Sam Levinson reportedly rewrote parts of the season to reflect the changes in the cast and the real-life events that shaped the show’s delay.

While no official release date has been set, HBO is aiming for a premiere window in mid-to-late 2026.

The show's return is expected to be more grounded, focusing on the emotional and mental growth of its characters as they navigate the transition from teen chaos to adult consequences.`,

    content: `Caitlin Clark, the standout guard for the University of Iowa, announced today that she will be declaring for the 2025 WNBA Draft.

Clark made the announcement via Instagram, thanking her fans and teammates for an "unforgettable journey." She finishes her college career as the NCAA's all-time leading scorer — men’s or women’s — and has become a cultural icon for her deep threes and electric court presence.

“I’m ready to take the next step in my basketball journey,” she wrote. “This has been the ride of a lifetime.”

Clark is widely expected to be the #1 overall pick in the draft, likely going to the Indiana Fever, who hold the top selection.

Her entry into the WNBA is already shaking up ticket sales and viewership projections. Sports insiders are calling it the most anticipated WNBA rookie debut since Diana Taurasi.`,

    shortDescription: "The tech could cut Mars travel time in half.",
    content: `NASA and DARPA have successfully tested a nuclear thermal propulsion engine in space for the first time, marking a breakthrough in spacecraft propulsion that could revolutionize deep space travel.

The test, conducted aboard a classified orbital platform, demonstrated stable and safe operation of the engine for over 90 minutes.

“Nuclear propulsion offers higher efficiency and more thrust than traditional chemical rockets,” said Dr. Monica Calderon, the project's lead engineer. “We could cut travel time to Mars by nearly 50%.”

The next step is to integrate the system into a future Mars-bound mission, possibly by 2030, though funding and political will are key factors in determining the timeline.

NASA has been developing this technology since the early 2020s, citing the need for faster, safer missions to the outer solar system — and eventually, human exploration of Mars.`,

    shortDescription: "The once-a-month treatment could change how chronic migraines are managed.",
    content: `A new migraine medication developed by NeuroLife Pharmaceuticals has shown significant success in Phase 2 clinical trials, reducing the frequency and severity of chronic migraines in more than 75% of participants.

The drug, called Nurodex, is a once-a-month injectable designed to block specific neural pain pathways without the harsh side effects of older treatments.

Patients in the trial reported a reduction in migraine days from an average of 14 per month to just 3 after two months of use. “This could be a game-changer for those with chronic migraines,” said Dr. Elena Ruiz, a neurologist and lead investigator of the study.

The FDA has granted the drug fast-track status due to its promising results and minimal side effects. Final approval could come as early as late 2025.

If approved, Nurodex would be the first monthly injectable migraine treatment that doesn’t require daily pills or rescue medications.`,
